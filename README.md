# C++ Core Concepts & Data Structures Repository

This repository is a **self-driven, book-oriented learning project** focused on building
**deep conceptual understanding, strong implementation skills, and real problem-solving ability**
in **C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

The goal is **not** to follow tutorials, but to learn by:
- reading authoritative books,
- implementing concepts from scratch,
- and solving problems independently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master **C++ core language concepts** (memory, pointers, OOP, STL, templates)
- Implement **Data Structures & Algorithms** cleanly and correctly
- Develop **problem-solving intuition** for interviews and competitive programming
- Prepare for:
  - 🎓 **MCA examinations** (theory + C/C++)
  - 💼 **Software engineering interviews**
- Build a **long-term personal CS knowledge base**

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **3-layer learning model**:

1. **Core** → Language mastery (C++ itself)
2. **DSA** → Clean implementations of data structures & algorithms
3. **Problems** → Application of concepts to real problems

> I decide the depth, pace, and approach for each topic.
> Thinking and implementation are prioritized over passive consumption.
